My Keras implementation of the Deep Semantic Similarity Model (DSSM).A random data generator is included in the code.

This model can be used as a search engine that helps people find out their desired document even with searching a query that:

1. has different words than the document
2. is abbreviation of the document words
3. changed the order of the words in the document
4. shortened words in the document
5. has typos
6. has spacing issues
